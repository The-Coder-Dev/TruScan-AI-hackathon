## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

**TruScan AI** is an AI-powered fraud detection platform built to protect users from modern digital scams like fake SMS alerts, phishing attempts, scam calls, and deepfake voice fraud.

With the rise of AI-generated scams, traditional spam detection is no longer enough. TruScan AI helps users detect suspicious messages and fraudulent calls in real time using advanced AI models for text analysis, speech transcription, and deepfake voice detection.

The platform supports multilingual detection, including:

- English
- Hindi
- Hinglish
- Roman Hindi

This makes it highly effective for real-world fraud detection, especially for Indian users, where mixed-language scam communication is common.
